	abstract = {The three-dimensional individual expression of street trees in the point cloud of urban road environments has important applications in many aspects. We propose a branch-trunk-constrained hierarchical clustering method to individually extract street trees from mobile laser scanning ({MLS}) point clouds. Firstly, potential tree crowns and trunks are selected through data preprocessing and regions of interest selection. Next, a branch-to-trunk matching method is proposed to locate the street tree positions. Then, tree crowns are segmented individually by a new hierarchical clustering method based on the identified tree positions. Finally, the tree trunk corresponding to each crown is selected from the potential ones to realize the complete individual extraction of street trees. The proposed method was tested and evaluated by three different {MLS} datasets. The results indicate that it can effectively extract individual street trees in different complex environments. Overall, the precision, recall and F-score of street tree positions locating have all reached 99.3\%, and the precision, recall and F-score of street tree instance segmentation are 98.2\%, 98.1\% and 98.1\%, respectively.},

Although deeplearning-based object detection networks are the state-of-the-art in computer vision, their adaptation to individual tree detection in urban areas has scarcely been studied. Some existing works have employed 2D object detection networks for this purpose. However, these have used three-dimensional information only in the form of projected feature maps. In contrast, we exploited the full 3D potential of airborne laser scanning ({ALS}) point clouds by using a 3D neural network for individual tree detection. Speciﬁcally, a sparse convolutional network was used for 3D feature extraction, feeding both semantic segmentation and circular object detection outputs, which were combined for further increased accuracy. We demonstrate the capability of our approach on an urban topographic {ALS} point cloud with 10,864 hand-labeled ground truth trees. Our method achieved an average precision of 83\% regarding the common 0.5 intersection over union criterion. 85\% of the stems were found correctly with a precision of 88\%, while tree area was covered by the individual tree detections with an F1 accuracy of 92\%. Thereby, we outperformed traditional delineation baselines and recent detection networks.},

Existing studies on tree modelling from laser scanning data are vast.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to accurately and automatically reconstruct detailed 3D tree models from laser scans. We ﬁrst extract an initial tree skeleton from the input point cloud by establishing a minimum spanning tree using the Dijkstra shortest-path algorithm. Then, the initial tree skeleton is pruned by iteratively removing redundant components.

Experiments on various types of trees from different data sources demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. The overall ﬁtting error (i.e., the distance between the input points and the output model) is less than 10 cm.

              Forest resource management and ecological assessment have been recently supported by emerging technologies. Terrestrial laser scanning ({TLS}) is one that can be quickly and accurately used to obtain three-dimensional forest information, and create good representations of forest vertical structure. {TLS} data can be exploited for highly significant tasks, particularly the segmentation and information extraction for individual trees. However, the existing single-tree segmentation methods suffer from low segmentation accuracy and poor robustness, and hence do not lead to satisfactory results for natural forests in complex environments. In this paper, we propose a trunk-growth ({TG}) method for single-tree point-cloud segmentation, and apply this method to the natural forest scenes of Shangri-La City in Northwest Yunnan, China. First, the point normal vector and its Z-axis component are used as trunk-growth constraints. Then, the points surrounding the trunk are searched to account for regrowth. Finally, the nearest distributed branch and leaf points are used to complete the individual tree segmentation. The results show that the {TG} method can effectively segment individual trees with an average
              F
              -score of 0.96. The proposed method applies to many types of trees with various growth shapes, and can effectively identify shrubs and herbs in complex scenes of natural forests. The promising outcomes of the {TG} method demonstrate the key advantages of combining plant morphology theory and {LiDAR} technology for advancing and optimizing forestry systems.},

	abstract = {In this paper, an instance segmentation method for tree extraction from {MLS} data sets in urban scenes is developed. The proposed method utilizes a supervoxel structure to organize the point clouds, and then extracts the detrended geometric features from the local context of supervoxels. Combined with the detrended features of the local context, the Random Forest ({RF}) classifier will be adopted to obtain the initial semantic labeling results of trees from point clouds. Afterwards, a local context-based regularization is iteratively performed to achieve global optimum on a global graphical model, in order to spatially smoothing the semantic labeling results. Finally, a graph-based segmentation is conducted to separate individual trees according to the semantic labeling results. The use of supervoxel structure can preserve the geometric boundaries of objects in the scene, and compared with point-based solutions, the supervoxelbased method can largely decrease the number of basic elements during the processing. Besides, the introduction of supervoxel contexts can extract the local information of an object making the feature extraction more robust and representative. Detrended geometric features can get over the redundant and in-salient information in the local context, so that discriminative features are obtained. Benefiting from the regularization process, the spatial smoothing is obtained based on initial labeling results from classic classifications such as {RF} classification. As a result, misclassification errors are removed to a large degree and semantic labeling results are thus smoothed. Based on the constructed global graphical model during the spatially smoothing process, a graph-based segmentation is applied to partition the graphical model for the clustering the instances of trees. The experiments on two test datasets have shown promising results, with an accuracy of the semantic labeling of trees reaching around 0.9. The segmentation of trees using graph-based algorithm also show acceptable results, with trees having simple structures and sparse distributions correctly separated, but for those cramped trees with complex structures, the points are over- or undersegmented.},

Segmenting individual trees from disordered, discrete, and high-density {TLS} point clouds is the premise for obtaining accurate individual tree structure parameters of forest understory, pest control and ﬁne modeling. In this study, we propose a bottom-up method to segment individual trees from {TLS} forest data based on density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise ({DBSCAN}). In addition, we also improve the {DBSCAN} based on the distance distribution matrix ({DDM}) to automatically and adaptively determine the optimal cluster number and the corresponding input parameters. Firstly, the proposed method is based on the improved {DBSCAN} to detect the trunks and obtain the initial clustering results. Then, the Hough circle ﬁtting method is used to modify the trunk detection results. Finally, individual tree segmentation is realized based on regional growth layer-by-layer clustering. In this paper, we use {TLS} multi-station scanning data from Chinese artiﬁcial forest and German mixed forest, and then evaluate the efﬁciency of the method from three aspects: overall segmentation, trunk detection and small tree segmentation. Furthermore, the proposed method is compared with three existing individual tree segmentation methods. The results show that the total recall, precision, and F1-score of the proposed method are 90.84\%, 95.38\% and 0.93, respectively. Compared with traditional {DBSCAN}, recall, accuracy and F1-score are increased by 6.96\%, 4.14\% and 0.06, respectively. The individual tree segmentation result of the proposed method is comparable to those of the existing methods, and the optimal parameters can be automatically extracted and the small trees under tall trees can be accurately segmented.},

The proposed hierarchical minimum cut method adopts the detected trunk points that are recognized according to pole like shape segmentation as foreground seed points and other points as background seed points, respectively. It constructs the undirected weighted graph of the foreground and background seed points to deduce a cost function for tree crown point segmentation with the decreasing ranking of tree trunk heights. The intermediate results lead to global optimization segmentation of individual trees in a hierarchical order. Finally, the structure metrics of the detected individual trees are calculated and checked with ﬁeld observations.

Among its applications, individual tree detection and segmentation are critical and prerequisite steps for deriving forest structural metrics, especially at the stand level. Although there are various tree detection and localization approaches, a comparative analysis of their performance on {LiDAR} data with different characteristics remains to be explored. In this study, a new trunkbased tree detection and localization approach (namely, height-difference-based) is proposed and compared to two state-of-the-art strategies—{DBSCAN}-based and height/density-based approaches. Leaf-off {LiDAR} data from two unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs}) and Geiger mode system with different point densities, geometric accuracies, and environmental complexities were used to evaluate the performance of these approaches in a forest plantation. The results from the {UAV} datasets suggest that {DBSCAN}-based and height/density-based approaches perform well in tree detection (F1 score {\textgreater} 0.99) and localization (with an accuracy of 0.1 m for point clouds with high geometric accuracy) after ﬁne-tuning the model thresholds; however, the processing time of the latter is much shorter. Even though our new height-difference-based approach introduces more false positives, it obtains a high tree detection rate from {UAV} datasets without ﬁne-tuning model thresholds. However, due to the limitations of the algorithm, the tree localization accuracy is worse than that of the other two approaches. On the other hand, the results from the Geiger mode dataset with low point density show that the performance of all approaches dramatically deteriorates. Among them, the proposed height-difference-based approach results in the greatest number of true positives and highest F1 score, making it the most suitable approach for low-density point clouds without the need for parameter/threshold ﬁne-tuning.},

To address the problem of 3D ﬁne extraction of street trees in complex road scenes, this paper designs and investigates a method for extracting street tree geometry and forest parameters from vehicle-mounted {LiDAR} point clouds in road scenes based on a Gaussian distributed regional growth algorithm and Voronoi range constraints. Firstly, a large number of non-tree and other noise points, such as ground points, buildings, shrubs and vehicle points, are ﬁltered by applying multi-geometric features; then, the main trunk of the street tree is extracted based on the vertical linear features of the tree and the region growth algorithm based on Gaussian distribution; secondly, a Voronoi polygon constraint is established to segment the single tree canopy region with the main trunk center of mass; ﬁnally, based on the extracted locations of the street trees and their 3D points, the tree growth parameters of individual trees are obtained for informative management and biomass estimation by combining geometric statistical methods. In this paper, the experimental data from vehicle-borne {LiDAR} point clouds of different typical areas were selected to verify that the proposed Gaussian-distributed regional growth algorithm can achieve ﬁne classiﬁcation and extraction of tree growth parameters for different types of roadside trees, with accuracy, recall and F1 values reaching 96.34\%, 97.22\% and 96.45\%, respectively.

Due to the complex architecture and growth pattern of plants, accurate modelling of the plant geometry is an extremely challenging task. Although realistic modelling of plants are widely studied in the context of computer graphics research, it also has profound impact on the biological study of plants. In order to perform various types of simulation studies under different environmental conditions and in understanding the physiology of plants in more details, synthetic models can be an extremely useful tool. Synthetic modelling approaches can be broadly categorized into three types. The ﬁrst type is the rule based procedural modeling approach, which does not account the real data into consideration. The second type of approach (also known as data driven modelling) performs modelling based on the real data obtained from 3D acquisition procedures. The third type of approach is interactive, which is based on user assistance. In this chapter, we focus on the modelling of the second category and revisit the recent state-of-the-art techniques performing reconstruction of plant geometry from real data. The algorithms can be classiﬁed into diﬀerent interlinked categories, which constitute the general pipeline of geometry reconstruction in data driven modelling framework. In the context of biological relevance of diﬀerent types of techniques, we discuss about the strengths and limitations of the approaches and the need of prior botanical knowledge to reconstruct the plant geometry in biologically feasible manner. Finally, we explore the quantitative assessment techniques which can be used to measure the quality of the reconstruction result with respect to the actual data.},

	abstract = {Detecting and segmenting individual trees in forest ecosystems with high-density and overlapping crowns often results in bias due to the limitations of the commonly used canopy height model ({CHM}). To address such limitations, this paper proposes a new method to segment individual trees and extract tree structural parameters. The method involves the following key steps: (1) unmanned aerial vehicle ({UAV})-scanned, high-density laser point clouds were classiﬁed, and a vegetation point cloud density model ({VPCDM}) was established by analyzing the spatial density distribution of the classiﬁed vegetation point cloud in the plane projection; and (2) a local maximum algorithm with an optimal window size was used to detect tree seed points and to extract tree heights, and an improved watershed algorithm was used to extract the tree crowns. The proposed method was tested at three sites with different canopy coverage rates in a pine-dominated forest in northern China. The results showed that (1) the kappa coefﬁcient between the proposed {VPCDM} and the commonly used {CHM} was 0.79, indicating that performance of the {VPCDM} is comparable to that of the {CHM}; (2) the local maximum algorithm with the optimal window size could be used to segment individual trees and obtain optimal single-tree segmentation accuracy and detection rate results; and (3) compared with the original watershed algorithm, the improved watershed algorithm signiﬁcantly increased the accuracy of canopy area extraction. In conclusion, the proposed {VPCDM} may provide an innovative data segmentation model for light detection and ranging ({LiDAR})-based high-density point clouds and enhance the accuracy of parameter extraction.},

	abstract = {In our daily lives, trees can be seen as the tallest and most noticeable representatives of the plant kingdom. Especially in urban areas, the individual tree is of high signiﬁcance and responsible for a manifold of positive effects on the environment and residents. In the context of urban tree registers and thus monitoring of urban vegetation, we propose a general concept for the segmentation of trees from 3D point clouds. Mobile Laser Scanning ({MLS}) is introduced as the preferred sensor. Based on an analysis of earlier work in this ﬁeld, we gather arguments and methods in order to involve segmentation in the bigger frame of a tree register workﬂow, including detailed modeling and change detection. Our concept for segmentation is based on a voxel-structure. In a ﬁrst step, region growing approaches are used for ground removal and rough segmentation. Later, graph-based optimization will separate neighboring trees. For now, only the general concept can be introduced—quantitative analysis and optimization of the steps will follow in future work.},
